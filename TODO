* Add ability for client to say it's logging binary data.
  That is, data that isn't line oriented, but which can be
  purely written out in terms of the current buffer size.

* Rotate server log files via the mechanism specified at:
  https://metacpan.org/pod/Log::Log4perl::FAQ#How-can-I-roll-over-my-logfiles-automatically-at-midnight
  But by size and count, not by midnight/time

* Do documentation in Pod::Weaver format
