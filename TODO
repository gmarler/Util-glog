* Add ability for client to say it's logging binary data.
  That is, data that isn't line oriented, but which can be
  purely written out in terms of the current buffer size.
  * This will involve the server sending a message to the client
    at log rotation time, and the client stopping the client, notifying
    the server it's been stopped, so the server can flush the remaining
    data to the log file.
  * The client will then need to start its program anew.

* Rotate server log files via the mechanism specified at:
  https://metacpan.org/pod/Log::Log4perl::FAQ#How-can-I-roll-over-my-logfiles-automatically-at-midnight
  But by size and count, not by midnight/time

* Do documentation in Pod::Weaver format
